  - Includes: uptime, freeHeap, heapSize, cpuFreq, debugLevel, firmware version
  - Hardware info: board type, display model, sensor status, OTA status
- `GET /api/timezones` - List of 88 timezones grouped by 13 geographic regions
- `POST /api/config` - Update configuration settings with detailed logging
  - Logs before/after values for all changed fields
  - Includes client IP address in logs
- `GET /api/mirror` - Raw framebuffer data (2048 bytes for 64×32 matrix)

### Configuration
- Default timezone: Australia/Sydney
- Default NTP server: pool.ntp.org
- Default LED diameter: 5 pixels
- Default LED gap: 0 pixels (no gap)
- Default LED color: Red (0xFF0000)
- Default brightness: 255 (maximum)
- Status bar height: 50 pixels
- Frame rate: ~30 FPS (33ms per frame)
- Morph animation: 20 steps

### Technical Details
- RGB LED Matrix (HUB75) pitch calculation: min(320/64, 190/32) = 5 pixels per LED
- Framebuffer: 8-bit intensity values (0-255) per pixel
- Sprite-based rendering for flicker-free display updates
- Row-major framebuffer layout: fb[y][x]
- Digit width: 9 pixels (reduced to fit HH:MM:SS with gaps)
- Digit spacing: 1 pixel gap between digits
- Total clock width: 63 pixels (fits centered in 64-pixel width)

### Fixed
- Color picker now properly allows color selection without value being overwritten by auto-refresh
- Timezone dropdown properly displays all 88 timezones organized by geographic region
- Web interface automatically applies changes without requiring manual save button click
- Serial logging now consistently uses [INFO] level for all configuration changes
- All field type checks in API now use consistent `.isNull()` pattern for reliability

### Known Issues
- None at initial release

### Security Notes
- Default OTA password is "change-me" - **CHANGE THIS BEFORE DEPLOYMENT**
- WiFi credentials stored in ESP32 NVS (Non-Volatile Storage)
- No authentication on web interface - suitable for trusted networks only

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-08

- Uses TFT_eSPI Font 4 for title and percentage text, Font 2 for status message
- Static `firstDraw` flag ensures screen clears only once at start of update
- Error messages use detailed switch-case for all ArduinoOTA error types

## [Unreleased]

- Additional display modes (date, temperature, custom messages)
- Multiple color schemes and themes
- Alarm functionality
- Touch screen support for direct configuration
- MQTT integration for remote control
- Automatic brightness adjustment based on ambient light
